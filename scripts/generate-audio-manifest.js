// This project uses pure client-side JS/HTML/CSS for audio detection.
// The Node-based manifest generator was intentionally removed per project preference.
// If you see this file, it's a placeholder — do not run Node scripts unless you opt in.

// Recommended workflow: place audio files under `audio/<album-id>/` using the album `id`
// from `js/data.js` and name tracks `01.mp3`, `02.mp3`, etc. `album.html` will
// attempt to detect files in the browser by trying common filename patterns.
